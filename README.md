  ## Description
  This is an application that simplifies the process of creating a high-quality readme file.  It walks the user through inputting data corresponding to the various sections of a readme file and automatically formats the file properly for a high-quality, polished look.  This application can be used to create a full readme file, or use to create a mostly-completed readme that you can add to later.

  ## Installation
  You will need to have VS Code, GitBash, and Node.js installed on your computer to use this application.  From the Github repository for this application, you can click on the Code button and copy the repository link.  Then using Gitbash, clone the repository to your local computer.  Then in VS Code, within the new repository you need to install Node Package Manager (npm init -y), then install Inquirer (npm i inquirer).

  ## Usage
  After all the above software is installed, from Integrated Terminal in VS Code run the command 'node index.js' to start the application.  From there input answers to the various question prompts.  Once completed your newly generated Readme file will be created in the GeneratedFiles folder within your local repository.
